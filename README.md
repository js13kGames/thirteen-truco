# 13 Truco

This game is a variation of the popular card game **Truco**. The main
differences is the presence of a card with number 13.

This card serves as a reverse Joker and will lose from any other card but
it will show itself as any other card and will become a 13 only when you drop
it. 

This means you might think you have a good hand when in fact, you would be luck
if you didn't raise stakes with such a low card.

I hope you don't get triskaidekaphobia while playing the game.
